running the app for the first time would take a little bit of time

once running verify at 

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

if it is Not running 
check terminal for errors 
no errors are displayed then just wait a few seconds

once you see the swagger ui 
run the dotnet and js servers
note: js server is in liveserver
